## Data Preprocess

We are working with a diabetes dataset that contains 19 variables from 403 observations. 
```{r}
data = read.table('diabetes.txt',header=TRUE)
head(data)
```

Missing values in the variable 'frame' were replaced with 'NA'.
```{r}
data$frame[data$frame==''] = NA
data$frame = droplevels(data$frame)
table(data$frame)
```

The variables 'id','bp.2s', and 'bp.2d' were dropped from the dataframe. 
```{r}
diabetes_reduced = select(data,-'id',-'bp.2s',-'bp.2d')
```
